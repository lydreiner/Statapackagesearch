{title:Title}

{phang}{bf:packagesearch} {hline 2} Module to search Stata code for the SSC packages used by the code {p_end}

{title:Description}

{pstd}{cmd:packagesearch} provides a tool that scans, parses, and matches all Stata .do files in a directory (and its subdirectories) against a list of all packages currently hosted at SSC. It outputs a list of candidate SSC packages that were (likely) used when code is run.  

{title:Syntax}

{p 8 16 2}
{cmd:packagesearch} {cmd:,} 
{cmd:codedir({it:directorytoscan})}[
{cmdab:files:ave}
{cmdab:excel:save}
{cmdab:false:pos}
{cmdab:install:founds}]


{title:Options}

{phang}{opt codedir(directorytoscan)} is required. It specifies the directory that contains the .do files to be scanned for SSC packages.

{phang}{opt filesave} outputs a list of all files that were parsed during the scanning process.

{phang}{opt excelsave} saves the results of the scan into an Excel spreadsheet titled candidatepackages.xlsx. This file is saved in the specified {it:directorytoscan} and will include a list of parsed programs if {opt filesave} is also indicated as an option.

{phang}{opt falsepos} removes packages that were frequently found to be false positives during beta testing. Presently this includes the following packages: {it: white, missing, index, dash, title, cluster, pre, bys}

{phang}{opt installfounds} installs all SSC packages found during the scanning process into the current working directory.
